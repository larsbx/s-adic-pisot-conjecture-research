# Specification: docs/rational-interval-arithmetic-spec.md, section 2.5.
#
# The quantitative half of the wrapping effect. Section 2.3's inclusion
# theorem says the enclosure contains the point and nothing about how far the
# two drift apart, so it cannot say whether refining a box ever decides
# anything. These bounds say it, from one number the caller supplies: a
# rational step factor `K >= 1` with `rad(F(X)) <= K rad(X)` for every
# enclosure confined to the region of interest.
#
# K belongs to the caller because it depends on the map. Everything here is
# the same for every map that has one, which is why it lives in the interval
# layer rather than in any one consumer's dynamics.
