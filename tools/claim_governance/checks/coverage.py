"""Every test names what it guards, and every guarded class is guarded.

The proof-driven-test discipline of `larsbx/crypto-composer`, where a test
may not exist without a proof statement, read onto a claim ledger: a test
declares the ledger claim it guards (or the contract it guards that is no
ledger claim), the declaration must resolve, and a claim whose warrant is an
executable computation must have at least one test that names it.

A declaration is a call in source, with a literal argument; examples inside
comments or string literals do not count. When the policy names a receipts file and
that file exists, it is the run log of the suite: a declaration the run did
not reach does not count, so a claim guarded only by a test body that is
never called is reported rather than credited.

The three states are distinct.  No receipts configured, or the file absent,
means the declarations stand on their own.  A parsed log means a declaration
counts only if the run reached it.  A *malformed* log is neither: it says
nothing about what executed, so it credits nothing and every required class
is reported uncovered until the file parses.  Reading a broken run log as an
absent one would make a green suite out of a file nobody can read.
